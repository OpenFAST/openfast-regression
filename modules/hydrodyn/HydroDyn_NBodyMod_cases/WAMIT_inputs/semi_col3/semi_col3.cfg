Custom configuration file for DeepCwind semi column 3 - 2019, M.Hall, NREL
ILOG=1        (omit ILOG in POT file, integrate log singularity)
ILOWGDF  = 0  (Generate low-order GDF from input geom - 0 since it's already low)
ILOWHI   = 0  (Low-Order/High Order Method (0/1))
IPERIN   = 2  (2 set inputs in .pot file angular frequencies -MH)
IPEROUT  = 1  (1 is default and sets outputs as periods (s))
IPLTDAT  = 0  (if 1, generate gdf_pan.dat/gdf_pat.dat files of meshing)
IRR      = 0  (if 1, Irregular frequencies removal)
ISOLVE   = 1  (solve method: 0 iterative, 1 direct, n block)
MONITR   = 1  (if 1, writes FORCE output data to monitor)
NUMHDR   = 0  (If 1, include a 1 line header)
